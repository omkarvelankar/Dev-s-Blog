    In the article First Website Using VS Code. We created a simple website webpage.
    Moving on further today we will learn how to add links to the websites.</p>

    <p>Points covered:
        <ul><li><a href="#useoflinks">Use of Links</a></li> 
            <li><a href="#anchortag">Anchor Tag</a></li> 
            <li><a href="#vscodeshortcut"> VS Code shortcut to add an address</a></li> 
        </ul>

    <h2 id="useoflinks" >Use of Links</h2>
    <p>Links are useful in navigating to other desired pages.
        By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers): <br>
        <ul> <li>An unvisited link is underlined and blue.</li>
        <li>A visited link is underlined and purple.</li>
        <li>An active link is underlined and red.</li>
    </ul> <br>
        
        
        
        If you are following steps from previous articles you will be able to link like I am going to do now.
        Go to VS Code and open up the project.</p>
    
        <h2 id="anchortag">Anchor Tag</h2>
    
  <p>Links are created using anchor tag.  <br>
   <b>Attributes:-</b> 
    href is used to provide an address to the link.</p>  

    &lt; a href="address"> Text that you want provide link to &gt; <br> <br>
    Let's create three HTML files.
    <ul> 
    <li>about.html</li>
    <li>portfolio.html</li>
    <li>contact.html</li>
     
    
</ul>
<p>Add the following code as per below in between body tags in the index.html file.</p>
    
<pre>
    &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;href="" &gt;Dev's Blog  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;href="" &gt;About  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;href="" &gt;Portfolio  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;href="" &gt;Contact  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

</pre>
<br>
<h2 id="vscodeshortcut">VS Code shortcut to add an address</h2>
<p >As all the files are located in the same folder we are going to use VS Code shortcut to provide the address to href
    Click in between " " marks in front of href and press the forward slash ( / ) button.
    And you will be able to see available files which you can add as a addresses.</p> <br>

    <p>Select the addresses. Click Save. Go to the browser and you will be able to see the links.</p>
    <p>Click on the links and you will be navigated to your respective pages.</p>
