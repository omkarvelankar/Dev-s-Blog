    In the article First Website Using VS Code. We created a simple website webpage.
    Moving on further today we will learn how to add links to the websites.</p>

    <p>Points covered:
        <ul><li>Use of Links</li>
            <li>Anchor Tag</li>
            <li> VS Code shortcut to add an address</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Use of Links</h3>
    <p>Links are useful in navigating to other desired pages.
        By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):
        An unvisited link is underlined and blue.
        A visited link is underlined and purple.
        An active link is underlined and red.
        If you are following steps from previous articles you will be able to link like I am going to do now.
        Go to VS Code and open up the project.</p>
    
        <h3>Anchor Tag</h3>
    
  <p>Links are created using anchor tag 
    Attributes:-
    href is used to provide an address to the link</p>  

    &lt; href="address"> Text that you want provide link to &gt;
    Let's create three HTML files
    <ul> 
    <ol>about.html</ol>
    <ol>portfolio.html</ol>
    <ol>contact.html</ol>
     
    
</ul>
<p>Add the following code as per below in between body tags in the index.html file</p>
    
<pre>
    &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;href="" &gt;Dev's Blog  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;href="" &gt;About  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;href="" &gt;Portfolio  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;href="" &gt;Contact  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

</pre>

<p>As all the files are located in the same folder we are going to use VS Code shortcut to provide the address to href
    Click in between " " marks in front of href and press the forward slash ( / ) button.
    And you will be able to see available files which you can add as a addresses</p>

    <p>Select the addresses. Click Save. Go to the browser and you will be able to see the links.</p>
